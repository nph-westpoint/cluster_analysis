What's happening in the world is horrible, there's no doubt about that, it incredibly sad to see and hear of so many deaths in the world because of this awful disease and I really do hope that we find a way to contain/cure this soon and save as many lives as possible.

Looking for a silver lining, however, I'm working from home and my mental health has massively improved because of it.

With my current working from home situation, I'm getting twice as much sleep as I normally do (usually only get around 4 or 5 hours tops), I'm not stressed and tired from driving for over an hour, I'm able to switch off at a reason time in the early evening and actually cook healthier meals, spend more time with my partner etc.

64,REMOVED,6,Desire,8,6,3,6,6,6,3,8,"I am one of the people who got a letter saying to stay in for 12 weeks so for me I am not anxious about when the lockdown will end because it won't end for me. I have severe asthma so I am a bit worried about getting it because I have a high risk of needing ventilation and of dying from it. Staying in really isn't an issue for me. I have been living with chronic illness since I was 12 and at my worst I was housebound for 2 years as a teenager so this is nothing compared to that. It has actually been annoying and anger inducing to see so many people complain about the lockdown and staying in, especially if they are middle class/rich with nothing to really worry about, when I have been through worse and was completely ignored and forgotten about like so many others and the key workers are going through much worse too. People are finally experiencing what it is like to live as a disabled person where you have to cancel and grieve for events, stay in for days at a time and survive on what little money the government decides is enough for a week. But still these people can go out and exercise and we still can't. It is also very anger-inducing to see so many people flaunt the rules and go out for BBQs and sunbathing. Also plenty of people going out for 'exercise' are gathering in groups and not observing the 2-meter distance with strangers. I also find it sad that the scientific literacy is so poor in this country. People really don't understand simple things that are being told to them about how the virus works, the symptoms, when to self isolate and what the lockdown means. People are dying every day because of this stupidity. There are also way too many stupid people trying to take down 5G masts because they are transmitting the virus. There are no words for that level. I find there is a bit of toxic positivity and toxic productivity on facebook and social media in general. Like people sharing the numbers of recovered to focus on the positives because everyone else is talking about how many died when these deaths matter. It isn't just the flu. A few days ago a 13 year old died alone and now he has been buried alone with no funeral. I don't want to hear about the recovered because that shouldn't be the focus and people need to be more scared and panicked so they stay indoors and don't get complacent. There should be video from the ICUs on the TV every night to make people think. Many of my friends are taking up new hobbies and getting round to decluttering and finishing those jobs around the house you never end up doing. This is great for them and I am happy they can have some time where they aren't burned out by work constantly but it makes me feel bad because I can't do that. Being as ill as I am is like a full time job and my spare energy goes on cooking, showering and if I am lucky cleaning. I had a migraine yesterday and the most I managed to do was water my plants. I won't be joining my friends in fun creative pursuits and making my space nicer to live in during the lockdown.   I have had some darker thoughts too that maybe we deserve this. I don't believe in any higher power or some personification of mother nature but this has revealed the true nature of humanity in the west. When this started at first people just got really racist ranging from joking about Kung Flu to actually beating up ethnically Chinese people who may never have been to China. Then there was the panic buying of everyone for themselves and protecting their own and screw the rest. A week later I saw images of bins filled with rotting food they had over-purchased whilst elderly and disabled people went hungry because there was nothing in the shops or they couldn't book an online slot. Panic buying continued at pharmacies and now people are short on necessary prescription medication. And now there are people breaking social distancing for selfish reasons like when everyone treated it like a bank holiday and went to Mount Snowdon or just didn't bother because they would be fine if they got the virus. No care about those of us who are the worst affected. Even my aunt who is a nurse went out whilst having the virus to get shopping and medication and could have spread it to many more. It is just a shame that this virus disproportionately affects the elderly and sick and doesn't target selfish and stupid people instead. Now my main worry is about the antibody test because the government wants to get the country and the economy going because money matters most and will possibly allow those who are immune back to work and leave the rest of us behind. It could be that the healthy and young can go back to work and I will still be left behind until there is a vaccine. I really can't risk my life and will lose even more of it than I already have to illness if most people go back to normal. Right now everyone has been dragged nearer to my level so for me that feels okay and something I can live with. My friends are doing virtual socials and chatting online more when usually I have to cancel party invitations and skip nights out. I do have an academic interest in this too as I studied infectious diseases before so it has been frustrating to see the government go against a lot of public health research but interesting to read the latest articles on the biology of the virus. I am probably one of the few who is not getting scared at reading about the virus itself even though I am susceptible to it",To everyone complaining about the lockdown and wanting to go and sunbathe: Stop being so selfish.

But I am also angry about how the UK handled this as we have some of the worst death rates in the world and the money wasted on things that were meant to help us but went to the friends of politicians. I am also realistic and I follow a lot of scientists on this and know that the vaccine is unlikely to be the end of the pandemic as most 3rd world countries will have to wait years for it and there will be those who refuse it. Plus the virus will mutate and the vaccine gives evolutionary pressure yet we aren't looking at permanent vaccination centres or how we would deal with this. I have been shielding for nearly a year now and want to feel safe but I feel most people my age just want to go back to the pub. I also feel that disabled people have been largely forgotten. I have severe asthma that doesn't count for group 6 with the vaccine but I am too fat and getting it for that reason. I think obese people should have the vaccine as we are at risk but I am sad that thin people who have asthma as bad as mine and are young have to wait,Looking forward to my vaccine but let's not forget the 130000 people dead due to incompetence and putting profit over people and the thousands left with long Covid who are being forgotten along with the disabled population.

I dealt with abelist and eugenicist views online through the pandemic and feel these are being expressed more than ever. I feel that in the UK they would rather us disabled people just died or stopped reminded people about the pandemic and quietly stay in our homes so they can go out and have fun. The only thing keeping me sane and not feeling gaslighted constantly is the online disabled and chronically ill community,The pandemic is still happening with 2000 people hospitalised today. But most of you would rather just carry on and pretend it isn't happening. Many of us clinically vulnerable can't and are trapped insider.

While the immediate risk of serious immediate consequences for triple vaxxed adults from omicron is very low, allowing such wide circulation of the virus by removing all restrictions and ending free testing is a recipe for new and more sesrious variants. It means that those who wish to protect themselves must continue with an abnormally restricted life.

I still feel angry for my teenage children who have missed so much of their schooling and are struggling to catch up- one taking A levels in the summer and another doing GCSEs without having received all the necessary input. 
I’m much sadder though for the ordinary things they’ve missed out on. My 16 year old had her birthday last week, and because she was ill with Covid she wasn’t at school. That’s the third birthday in a row she hasn’t been able to properly celebrate. We are planning a party in a few weeks but it’s not the same as actually on the day. 
They’ve also missed out on sleepovers, trips with school, time with friends etc which can never be replaced. 
As a primary school year 2 teacher I notice how fragile the younger children are emotionally. I had children crying on the last day of term before the Christmas holidays, anxious that they might not be coming back. Many of them need the reassurance of a cuddly toy at school, which I wouldn’t have allowed in previous years. 
 They are constantly needy of adult intervention, unable to sort out the ordinary playground squabbles. I’m assuming this is because of the lack of interaction with other children during the lockdowns. I’m also noticing language delays and academically they’re certainly ‘behind’ as a cohort.

A large part of this, I think, is due to the war in Ukraine, which has of course taken precedence and there's less said in the media about COVID. I'm a PhD student, and I live quite an isolated existence -- there's been few occasions in the last few months where I've been part of a large group, so I don't have too many worries about COVID right now. 

  I would say though that I still wear a mask whenever I'm shopping for food or going for a coffee. Part of this is just what I've become accustomed to I think, it almost feels natural now to slip on a mask before I enter a building, and perhaps there's a slightly irrational fear of catching the virus. I sometimes think this, particularly as I've noticed in the last few days how few people are wearing masks -- it's a rarity now. I know that's to do with government slacking of rules of course, but I still feel a slight urge to wear one, and feel exposed when I don't. The pressure seems to be changing towards not wearing one. 

It's been a while too since I had my double vaccines. This should perhaps now be a slight cause for concern, and I have noted on the BBC website in recent weeks that the case rates are rising, particularly in Scotland. One of my biggest worries is long COVID. I've heard bad things about it, particularly that the brain shrinks. If mine shrinks any more I think I will be in trouble.

Finally, I sometimes go to my parents, who are over 70. That's where I'd be worried about COVID. Did I have it and would I pass it on unwillingly? Should I always wear a mask with them? It's the times when I see them that I feel the greatest concern.","Keep cautious. Don't let your guard down.

At this point, I'm living my life. I cannot do more to protect myself, and so at this point I see going back to normal as the sensible option. Carrying on with how we've approached COVID (isolations) cannot be a long-term strategy -- people need friends, family, socialising, and, quite frankly, we can't add endlessly to economic debt. But I do think it's sensible to work more from home and wear masks, as these things don't take away anything from our lives.

My views are coloured by the fact that, last year, in Feb, my best friend from childhood overdosed and died (I found out in April, after this survey I think). She had had severe mental health/drug issues till the last three years of her life, where she found coping mechanisms -- seeing friends, going out dancing, etc. She relapsed six months into the pandemic and overdosed five months later. The pandemic kills in more than one way. She is dead because she was forced to isolate. Mental health isn't an endless resource.

I find it exceptionally frustrating that my parents won't fly to meet their now 2.5yr old grandson because they're scared of COVID.

It's not over, and there will be thousands who die like him because our government now thinks the NHS won't be swamped by cases and therefore life can go back to normal.  
It can for those who are fit and healthy, but 40% of our population isn't.  The NHS won't recover either, so thousands and thousands of perfectly preventable deaths will happen because there simply aren't enough staff with enough time to deal with all of the people who need healthcare.

My sister works in the NHS as a home carer, visiting people in their homes, which puts her at tremendous risk. Personally, my finances are in a bad state of affairs as I work in entertainments and have had no work at all for several weeks and no income. I'm struggling to pay for food.
The lockdown itself hasn't bothered me too much, I've been able to keep myself busy so far, but the general anxiety of the growing crisis edging ever closer to my life is causing me some distress.","I'm fearful that life will never be the same again one way or another, and that it will take a long time for anything resembling normality to return, if at all.",5,6,4,9,6,4,Yes,131,645,34,160,en,en,16,0.02,2020-04-06T16:59:15.143Z,2020-04-06T17:06:49.673Z,454.53,41,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Unemployed (and job seeking),English,United Kingdom,Male,No,7,Anger,9,8,7,5,8,4,5,2,"At the every beginning of the crisis I had fears over whether or not the government was capable of handling the situation effectively, whether the people who were tasked with taking charge of the official response and protecting the population as much as possible would be up to the task. I liked to think that at the very least they would be able to make the most basic efforts of minimising transmission as much as possible
As I sit here almost a full year later having lived through the crisis as it unfolded, the overwhelming emotions I have right now are very much anger and disgust. I believe that the government had the information they needed about the potential issues that Covid could create, but at this point it's clear that they chose to ignore the people who were advising them and pursue a dangerous course of action that has resulted in one of the worst infection and death rates in the world. Inactivity at critical moments, conflicting information, late decisions and bad judgment all contributed to what has turned into what feels like a complete failure of governance.
Not only that, but they have actively used the crisis as a means to award lucrative Covid-related contracts to personal friends and associates, often without any service or materials coming back in exchange.
Now my greatest fear is that the amount of time between the first and second stages of the vaccinations - more time than recommended by the vaccine makers and industry experts - could potentially create the perfect environment for a resistant strain to develop, alongside the mutations we're seeing appear.
As a person who contracted a moderate Covid infection over Christmas I can confirm that this feels different to anything I have ever experienced before, and almost three months later I still have minor issues occasionally as a result. I believe that this could all have been avoided to a large extent, but for the decisions and actions of the very people who we trusted to make competent and wise choices on our behalf.","Currently angry at the government, sad for society in general and fearful over the future developments of the virus, as well as the economic situation in the country.",6,5,6,9,6,5,Yes,364,2023,31,166,en,en,23,0.01,2021-03-05T21:13:01.719Z,2021-03-05T21:37:21.716Z,1459.997,42,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Unemployed (and job seeking),English,United Kingdom,Male,No,7,Disgust,7,8,7,7,6,3,5,1,"I feel that we have lost all control over the situation now, or what control we ever had.

I also feel absolutely disgusted over the behaviour of others at the minute, as they have no thought for other people. Their reckless behaviour could kill someone and the thought that their recklessness could even lead to me being responsible for killing someone is absolutely terrifying. The lack of leadership in this country is also leaving me rather confused about the whole situation and how it will progress, leaving me fearful of what is really to come.",Stay inside for all of us so we can get out of this mess sooner!!!,5,2,7,9,1,1,Yes,182,971,18,66,en,en,11,0.01,2020-04-06T15:15:40.113Z,2020-04-06T15:23:34.243Z,474.13,22,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,Unemployed (and job seeking),English,United Kingdom,Female,No,5,Anxiety,6,6,5,7,4,4,4,6,"I feel a lot of disgust and anger towards the government for its gross mishandling of the current situation.

They have removed all help for people affected by the corona virus to cover the public money they gave to their friends. This makes me extremely angry and eager for the next general election. The rapid increase of corona virus running through the country right now is explicitly the fault of the Tory party and Boris Johnson himself. Boris Johnson should be made to resign for his failings.,The Tory party has failed us all in favor of lining their friends pockets.
